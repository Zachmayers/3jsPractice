        <p></p>
        A graduate of the University of Central Florida <br />(in May of 2022).

        <p></p>

        <p>
          Passionate to learn about software development, system design, and
          effective project-management.

        <p>Amateur-professional veggie-chef extraordinaire.</p>

        <h2 class="glitch">What do you like?</h2>
        <p>
          My favorite languages/Frameworks to work with are Python, Flask, and
          React.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love to make one off scripts/bots for discord, quick web apps, and
          anything that automates a task in my daily life. Being able to solve
          problems and see something you made work for you is the most rewarding
          part of Software Development.
        </p>

        <p>
          Project management is one of my greatest strengths. I especially love
          working with a team that is willing to adopt an agile approach. I have
          experience bringing products to market with a lean-startup mentality,
          and a strong foundation in business mangement and digital marketing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Playing the drums, listening to live music, a great cup of coffee, and
          tall buildings.

        <p>
          In the past few years I have had the opportunity to work with some
          great people on some really cool projects. I had the opportunity to
          work with some small businesses like
          <a href="https://www.rusticsbytl.com/" target="_blank"
            >Rustics by TL</a
          >, helping with some digital media buying, and making some
          personalized internal tools for inventory management, sata tracking
        </p>

        <h2 class="glitch">Have I made anything cool recently?</h2>

        <p>Lots of cool things!</p>
        <p>
          One of my favorite projects to date was one I made with a small group
          of classmates that we called
          <a href="https://www.listenin.us" target="_blank">listenin.us</a>.
          It's a small web app that interacts with your spotify account, pulling
          your most listened to artists, songs, and some reccomendations based
          off songs you like to listen to.
